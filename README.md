# Django-authentication-system
This is a Django authentication system.
It is applicable in systems which require user registration and authentication, like e-commerce and social platforms.

# Development
Having struggled for a long time with Django authentication, I found it nice to create this project and share with everyone who would like to learn authentication and authorization in Django.
I documented this system in detail on [Hashnode](https://brayo.hashnode.dev/djangos-authentication-and-authorisation). 

# API Usage
To use the API, you can clone it by running
```
git clone https://github.com/brian-mwangi-kamau/Django-authentication-system.git
```
then running
```
pip install requirements.txt
```
Run the commands:
```
python manage.py makemigrations
python manage.py migrate
```
Run the command below to start the server:
```
python manage.py runserver
```

The server will run and you can visit http://127.0.0.1:8000/
